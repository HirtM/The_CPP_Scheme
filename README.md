# The_CPP_Scheme
The Cold Pool Perturbation (CPP) scheme strengthens cold pools gust fronts to enhance cold pool driven convective initiation. In this repository, the impact of the CPP scheme is investigated. 
 
This repository accompanies a publication on the CPP scheme. 


The different jupyter notebooks iclude: 
- 18_plot_example_fields_whole_period: Here, example, 2d-horizontal fields (e.g. w, theta-v, precip,...) are displayed for all the considered days. 
- 
- 19_Parameter_Sensitivity.ipynb: In this notebook, several CPP parameters are modified and the change of the CPP impact evaluated. 
- CPdetection_summary.ipynb: This notebook illustrates some examples and results of the cold pool detection as well as the mask that is used in the detection algorithm to exclude the Alpes.  (Provided by C. Sackrenz)
- 15_ColdPooldetection.ipynb: This notebook shows some further analyses of the cold pool detection outcomes and also produces the corresponding plot used in the paper. 


The different pyhton scripts include utility functions used in the notebooks, e.g. plotting functions, diagnostics functions, ...
